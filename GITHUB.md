    --secondary-color: #2ecc71;
    --dark-color: #2c3e50;

    --box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    --transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Adding More Games

To add more games, copy the `game-card` block in the `index.html` file and modify the content:

```html
<div class="game-card">

        <img src="game-image.jpg" alt="Game Name">
    </div>
    <div class="game-info">

        <p>Game description</p>
